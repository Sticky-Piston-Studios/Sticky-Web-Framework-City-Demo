# Sticky Web Backend

Developed by Sticky Piston Studion, **Sticky Web Backend** is a universal, open-source framework revolutinising the creation of API backend application by offering a no-code, no-recompilation, dynamically-configurabl system built with ASP.NET. It is designed with the vision of democratizing API creation, making it approachable and user-friendly for individuals with minimal to no programming skills. Full configurability via a text config file, in combination with its generic achitecture, greately reduces the need for any code changes.

## Features

- No-code: You don't need to write any code to set up your backend.
- Fully configurable: All configuration is done through a simple config file.
- Dynamic setup: The backend sets up dynamically based on the config file.
- Open-source: You can view and modify the source code to suit your needs.
- Simpliticty: A clean base to build upon, in case some additional logic is to be added.
